                <p class="des"> The 40s was a turning point in music history. Jazz music was slowly starting to die out, becoming less and less popular. It was around this time that many jazz clubs began to shut down, however another evolution of jazz was on the rise and took the top spot this decade, Blues.

               <p class="des"> As I said before the 40s were a very influential time in music history. I say this because Blues was building grounds for rock n' roll. The very next decade rock would take the top spot as the #1 music genre, but I'll get to that later. Some of the best Blues songs from around this time were "Boogie Chillen", "Crossroads", and "Howlin' Wolf".
