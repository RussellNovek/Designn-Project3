                <p class="des"> Ahh, the 70s, tie-dye, afros, circular sunglasses and peace signs galore. No one was safe from the hippie agenda, and I'm not sure that many people minded. Along with all of this came a new genre, a groovier genre, it's disco, baby.

                   <p class="des"> In the 70s, disco was so popular that the only way for it to stop was a bond fire of disco records at a baseball game. Yes, that's true, but it's a story for another day. Disco is typified by four-on-the-floor beats, syncopated basslines, string sections, horns, electric piano, synthesizers, and electric rhythm guitars, making it easy to dance to. Disco was also very popular in the urban nightlife scene, with hit songs like "Stayin' Alive", "Don't Stop 'till You Get Enough" and "September", just to name a few of the unbelievably groovy songs of the 70s.
