            <p class="des">Music, It's all around us. It surrounds us. Music is an important part of my life, and if you're reading this, it might be a part of yours as well. This website is about the thing we love so much. Music. To be more specific this website is about the evolution of music in the last century, as the title suggests. We will go decade to decade from 1920 to today. Learn how music changed and evolved into what it is today. I hope you will learn something new from this site, and tell your friends so they can learn it too. So without further ado, welcome to my website.
