                <p class="des"> The 60s were a time of innovation, it brought colour to the black and white of the 50s. Lava lamps, troll dolls, mood rings and more of our favourite things were on the rise in the 60s. Not only that but Beatlemania, the craze that swept the world, a musical revolution if you would. The rise of the Beatles was also the rise of a new genre of music, Pop.

               <p class="des"> Pop music, a genre we are very familiar with today. However, back then Pop wasn't like it is today. In the 60s, there was no electrical music, no fake drums or sound effects, it was just a band. And although you may think that limited to only a band, you are most definitely mistaken. the 60s gave us some of the greatest hits known today like "I Want To Hold Your Hand", "California Dreamin' ", "God Only Knows", and of course "Love Me Do".
